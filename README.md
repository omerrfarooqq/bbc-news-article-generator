# BBC News Headline Generator

This is an NLP project that generates BBC-style news text using a TensorFlow LSTM model trained on actual BBC news headlines and descriptions.

## Features
- Tokenization and text vectorization using Keras
- LSTM 
- Dynamic text generation from seed inputs

Output
Seed: `Headline`  
Generated: `Headline + Generated Article`

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Train the model:
    ```
    although its already trained but you can train it further
    ```
3. Generate text:
    ```
    i have created the function to generate the text, takes two parameters.
    ```
code is a bit messy, but you will understand what to do :)

## Model Weights
You can load pre-trained weights from `epoch_0067.weights.h5`.
